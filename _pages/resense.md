Reversed-polarity III-nitride Sensors for Enhanced UV-detection (ReSensE)
======

[ReSensE](https://cordis.europa.eu/project/id/898704) is a three-year Marie Skłodowska-Curie Individual (Global) Fellowship, funded by the [European Commission](https://marie-sklodowska-curie-actions.ec.europa.eu/).

The Action “ReSensE” (Reversed-polarity III-nitride Sensors for Enhanced UV-detection) aims at developing a new type of semiconductor material, and at its use for enabling more efficient sensors of ultraviolet light.

III-nitride materials such as GaN, AlN and their alloys constitute a very well-known semiconductor system, with tremendous industrial applications from energy-saving LED bulbs and lasers to the next generation of high-frequency transistors for wireless telecommunication.

To make these devices available to the benefit of the general public, though, scientists need first to be able to synthesize the materials from their atomic constituents. This is done through a process called epitaxy, in which the atoms that form the materials are stacked, layer by layer, in a controlled way, using specially designed reactors at very high temperatures. In theory the stacking order can be along either of the two possible directions (or polarities), but one of them is much easier to control and almost always used.

However, III-nitride materials grown with standard polarity have internal electric fields oriented in a direction that is very detrimental to the operation of most the final devices. For this reason, ReSensE wants to develop new epitaxial techniques for growing III-nitride materials with their polarity reversed (the so-called nitrogen-polarity). In addition to that, ReSensE investigates the use of these new materials in highly efficient UV sensors, which could be used in flame detection systems for fire prevention, as well as in many other applications such as control of industrial processes, diagnostic equipment, and space explorations.

The overall objectives of the Action are first to demonstrate high-quality nitrogen polar AlN and AlGaN materials and then to fabricate and characterize the first prototype of an ultraviolet photodetector based on nitrogen polar AlGaN.
